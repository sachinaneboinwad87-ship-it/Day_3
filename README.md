**_Python If Else Statements - Conditional Statements_**
In Python, If-Else is a fundamental conditional statement used for decision-making in programming. 
If...Else statement allows to execution of specific blocks of code depending on the condition is True or False.

**_if Statement_**
if statement is the most simple decision-making statement.
If the condition evaluates to True, the block of code inside the if statement is executed.

**_if-else Statement_**
if-else statement is a control statement that helps in decision-making based on specific conditions. 
When the if condition is False. If the condition in the if statement is not true,
the else block will be executed.

**_Nested If Else Statement_**
Nested if-else statement occurs when if...else structure is placed inside another if or else block. 
Nested If-else allows the execution of specific code blocks based on a series of conditional checks.

**_if-eli-else Statement_**
if-elif-else statement in Python is used for multi-way decision-making. 
This allows us to check multiple conditions sequentially and execute a specific block of code when a condition is True.
If none of the conditions are true, the else block is executed.
